- First, you need to pick an exchange with low commissions.
- The asset needs to have a very high market cap. Preferably from the top 50 by market cap.
- The spread should be very high along with the daily volume.
- The asset needs to have very strong fundamentals, healthy on-chain metrics, and a good, reputable history.
- The assets must fluctuate by at least 1% every 4 hours on average.

## Exchange Related Notes

- Our recommended exchange is [Bybit.com](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/invite?ref=YMYQ0%230)
- Regardless of the exchange, to close the order, make a post-only limit order to save on fees rather than using the take-profit (TP) feature.

## Required Indicators

- The AlgoStorm Fire & Water Dragon (**FWD**) indicator.
- The AlgoStorm Volcanic Trend Dragon (**VTD**) indicator.
- The AlgoStorm Legendary Momentum Dragon (**LMD**) indicator.

## Time Frames

- Analyze the chart on the following time frames:
	- The daily time frame.
	- The 4-hour time frame.
	- The 15-minute time frame.
	- The 1-minute time frame.

> **Note 1**: Regardless of whether you are doing scalping, day trading, or swing trading, you always need to analyze the chart on all major time frames.

> **Note 2**: For day traders, we recommend monitoring the 15-minute charts. For swing traders, we recommend monitoring the 4-hour charts.

## Preparations

- Thoroughly analyze the market structure.
- Identify the **support/demand** and **resistance/supply** zones.
- Plot the **anchored VWAP** from the swing high and the swing low.
- Draw the **trend lines**.

## When To Enter?

### For Long Positions

- You need to spot a **regular bullish divergence** on both the 15-minute and the 1-minute time frames. You can identify these divergences using both the **LMD** and **VTD** indicators. If you are swing trading, you can spot such divergences on the high time frames instead (e.g. The daily and the 4-hour).
- The price action must crossover the **FWD Central Band** after touching the **FWD's Lower Extreme Zone**.
- The **LMD** indicator must not be overbought (**above 80**).

### For Short Positions

- You need to spot a **regular bearish divergence** on both the 15-minute and the 1-minute time frames. You can identify these divergences using both the **LMD** and **VTD** indicators. If you are swing trading, you can spot such divergences on the high time frames instead (e.g. The daily and the 4-hour).
- The price action must crossunder the **FWD Central Band** after touching the **FWD's Upper Extreme Zone**.
- The **LMD** indicator must not be oversold (**below 20**).

## Where To Place The Stop Loss?

- Place the stop loss **0.2%** beyond the most recent key level of support/resistance on the 15-minute time frame. You can also use the key levels on the 4-hour time frame if you are swing trading.

## When To Take Profit?

- Calculate the take profit by multiplying the distance of the stop loss from the entry by **1.5** as we are using a risk to reward ratio of **1:1.5**.
- You can also consider selling your order in stages at certain key levels.

## Extra Pro Tips

1. It is advisable not to risk more than **3%** per trade.
2. When you are starting out, do not use leverage. When you become consistently profitable for at least **8 months** in a row, you can then consider using low leverage (**x2-x5**).

**Side Note:** Many professional traders **enter** and **exit** the market **in stages**.

## For Reference
