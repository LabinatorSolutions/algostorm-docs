## Introduction

This is a mean reversion strategy that utilizes the AlgoStorm's premium indicators. It is suitable for both day traders and swing traders.

## Requirements

- This strategy is mostly designed for **Cryptocurrencies**. It can work though for other asset classes.
- First, you need to pick an exchange with low commissions.
- The asset needs to have a very high market cap. Preferably from the top 50 by market cap.
- The spread should be very high along with the daily volume.
- The asset needs to have very strong fundamentals, healthy on-chain metrics, and a good, reputable history.
- The assets must fluctuate by at least 1% every 4 hours on average.
- Check our Discord server for our selected list of assets that are suitable for trading. To join, visit: [AlgoStorm.com](https://algostorm.com)

## Exchange Related Notes

- Our recommended exchange is [Bybit.com](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/invite?ref=YMYQ0%230)
- Regardless of the exchange, to close the order, make a post-only limit order to save on fees rather than using the take-profit (TP) feature.

## Preparations

- Thoroughly analyze the market structure.
- Identify the **support** and **resistance** zones on all major time frames.
- Plot the **anchored VWAP** from the swing high and the swing low on all major time frames.
- Analyze the market structure on all major time frames.
- Draw the **trend lines** on all major time frames.

**Note**: The major time frames in our book are the following: The weekly, daily, hourly, and 15-minute time frames.

## Required Indicators

	- The 4-hour time frame.
	- The 1-hour time frame.
	- The 15-minute time frame.

> **Note 2**: For day traders, we recommend monitoring the 15-minute charts. For swing traders, we recommend monitoring the 4-hour charts.

## When To Enter?

### For Long Positions

- You need to identify a regular **bullish divergence** either on the **LMD** or the **VTD** indicators. When the trend is getting weaker, you would also see higher lows and decceleration in the movement.
- The blue fast channel must start shaping upwards and it needs not to be lower than the red slow channel.
- The price action must cross above the red slow channel of the **FWD** indicator. When that happens, then it means the strong trend has ended and a reversal is probable to happen.
- The price action must also be above the **VWAP** of the trading session and above the **200 linear regression slope** of the **FWD** indicator.
- The **LMD** indicator must not be overbought (**above 80**).

### For Short Positions

- You need to identify a regular **bearish divergence** either on the **LMD** or the **VTD** indicators. When the trend is getting weaker, you would also see lower highs and decceleration in the movement.
- The blue fast channel must start shaping downward and it needs not to be higher than the red slow channel.
- The price action must cross below the red slow channel of the **FWD** indicator. When that happens, then it means the strong trend has ended and a reversal is probable to happen.
- The price action must also be below the **VWAP** of the trading session and below the **200 linear regression slope** of the **FWD** indicator.
- The **LMD** indicator must not be oversold (**below 20**).

## Where To Place The Stop Loss?

- Place the stop loss **0.4%** beyond the most recent key level of support/resistance on the 15-minute time frame. You can also use the key levels on the 4-hour time frame if you are swing trading.

## When To Take Profit?

- Calculate the take profit by multiplying the distance of the stop loss from the entry by **1.5** as we are using a risk to reward ratio of **1:1.5**.
- You can also consider selling your order in stages at certain key levels.

## Extra Pro Tips

1. For best results, practice the art of **entering** and **exiting** the order **in stages**.
2. It is advisable not to risk more than **1%-2%** per trade.
3. When you are starting out, do not use leverage. When you become consistently profitable for at least **8 months** in a row, you can then consider using very low leverage (**x2-x5**).
