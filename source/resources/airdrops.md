# Airdrops

## What Are Air Drops?

Airdrops are a marketing strategy used by projects to:
- Bring awareness to their platform/product
- Entice users to engage with their platform/product.

This is accomplished by projects giving away free tokens/coins to potential users that meet certain criteria.

Airdrops can also be used to reward loyal community members and early adopters.

Usually, a project will announce that they are launching an airdrop, and provide instructions on how to claim or meet the eligibility requirements to receive tokens. Your amount of usage often determines how many tokens you will receive.

Airdrops are essential because it allows a project to gain immediate attention, and a bit of traction if people start buying or staking tokens.

## How To Receive Airdrops

The best way to receive these airdrops is to be active and participate in new projects (since you almost never know exactly which project is going to do an airdrop).

You should also follow and monitor different crypto airdrop sites like:

- https://airdropalert.com/

**Note**: Last but certainly not least, stay active within the crypto community. Some of these airdrops have been happening without much notification. If you aren’t active or at least following the Crypto Twitter community, you will miss out.

## Precautions

Airdrops can be a great way to build up your stack at little to no cost. However, please understand that not all airdrops are the same.
Bad actors will advertise a fake airdrop in hopes of luring you to a fake landing page and having you connect your wallet to claim free tokens.
To avoid being scammed, always do your due diligence and perform complete analysis on Twitter and other platforms to make sure that trustworthy people have “approved” the safety of an airdrop.
