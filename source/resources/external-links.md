## Wallets 

!!!warning Warning
Storing crypto should be done with extreme caution. It is highly recommended to use only hardware wallets to keep your crypto safe. Any wallet that you have to download to your computer creates a vector for malware and puts your funds at risk. Some crypto coins may not have wallets and should be kept on exchange. This is not a comprehensive list of all the wallets.
