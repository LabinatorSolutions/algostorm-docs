# Yield Farming

## What is Yield Farming?

Yield farming is a way to generate passive income with cryptocurrency holdings. Instead of holding your crypto on exchanges or wallets, you can put it in decentralized financial applications and earn rewards in return.

DeFi projects don’t hold your money, which is why they can’t facilitate loans or trading unless someone provides liquidity. To attract liquidity providers (LPs), applications share fees with them and sometimes provide extra incentives like governance tokens.

For instance, Compound enables people to loan and borrow money in a decentralized way. Let’s say you want to borrow some ETH. Compound on its own can’t give it to you, so it attracts lenders by offering COMP tokens atop the interest they will get.

On another platform, Uniswap, LPs create an opportunity for trading. If you want to sell your ETH to USDC, you will need someone to have USDC on Uniswap. The more tokens on each side of the trade, the better price you will get if you trade large amounts of money. Hence, Uniswap is motivated to incentivize its LPs with fees and UNI token.

People value some of these tokens because they give access to the protocol’s profits, others because they give decision-making power in successful projects. While specific governance tokens are worth holding, those that provide 2,000% APR are not meant for the long term as high selling pressure comes with higher farming percent returns.

## The Risks of Yield Farming

Yield farming comes with risks such as smart contract exploits, rug pulls, impermanent loss, and dilution.

One of the key risks is smart contracts vulnerabilities. Many protocols are built and developed by small teams with limited budgets, increasing the risk that their apps have bugs. Moreover, even flawless smart-contracts are still connected to dozens of other projects and can suffer from unexpected exploits.

The complexity of these integrations make it possible to break projects that have fundamentally sound code. If you are locking your funds in smart contracts, there is always a chance of losing your entire principal.

Next, yield farming is a highly competitive and fast-paced market where rewards can fluctuate rapidly. As a result, if a farming strategy generates outsized profits, many farmers will jump on the opportunity, diminishing the potential reward for everyone.

Another major risk is impermanent loss (IL) which comes up when you are depositing liquidity on decentralized exchanges. IL happens when the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The more significant this change is, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss.

Lastly, farmers can suffer from rug pulls where developers run away with deposited funds or pull liquidity from the market. In an environment where many teams are anonymous, this is especially common.
