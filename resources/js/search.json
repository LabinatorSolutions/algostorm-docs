Your amount of usage often determines how many tokens you will receive.","Airdrops are essential because it allows a project to gain immediate attention, and a bit of traction if people start buying or staking tokens."]},{"l":"How To Receive Airdrops","p":["The best way to receive these airdrops is to be active and participate in new projects (since you almost never know exactly which project is going to do an airdrop).","You should also follow and monitor different crypto airdrop sites like:","https://airdrops.io/","https://airdropalert.com/","Note: Last but certainly not least, stay active within the crypto community.

Instead of holding your crypto on exchanges or wallets, you can put it in decentralized financial applications and earn rewards in return.","DeFi projects don’t hold your money, which is why they can’t facilitate loans or trading unless someone provides liquidity. To attract liquidity providers (LPs), applications share fees with them and sometimes provide extra incentives like governance tokens.","For instance, Compound enables people to loan and borrow money in a decentralized way. Let’s say you want to borrow some ETH. Compound on its own can’t give it to you, so it attracts lenders by offering COMP tokens atop the interest they will get.","On another platform, Uniswap, LPs create an opportunity for trading. If you want to sell your ETH to USDC, you will need someone to have USDC on Uniswap. The more tokens on each side of the trade, the better price you will get if you trade large amounts of money. Hence, Uniswap is motivated to incentivize its LPs with fees and UNI token.","People value some of these tokens because they give access to the protocol’s profits, others because they give decision-making power in successful projects. While specific governance tokens are worth holding, those that provide 2,000% APR are not meant for the long term as high selling pressure comes with higher farming percent returns."]},{"l":"The Risks of Yield Farming","p":["Yield farming comes with risks such as smart contract exploits, rug pulls, impermanent loss, and dilution.","One of the key risks is smart contracts vulnerabilities. Many protocols are built and developed by small teams with limited budgets, increasing the risk that their apps have bugs. Moreover, even flawless smart-contracts are still connected to dozens of other projects and can suffer from unexpected exploits.","The complexity of these integrations make it possible to break projects that have fundamentally sound code. If you are locking your funds in smart contracts, there is always a chance of losing your entire principal.","Next, yield farming is a highly competitive and fast-paced market where rewards can fluctuate rapidly. As a result, if a farming strategy generates outsized profits, many farmers will jump on the opportunity, diminishing the potential reward for everyone.","Another major risk is impermanent loss (IL) which comes up when you are depositing liquidity on decentralized exchanges. IL happens when the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them. The more significant this change is, the more you are exposed to impermanent loss.","Lastly, farmers can suffer from rug pulls where developers run away with deposited funds or pull liquidity from the market. In an environment where many teams are anonymous, this is especially common."]},{"i":"further-reading--resources","l":"Further Reading & Resources","p":["The Basics Of Yield Farming","Yield Farming Tutorials by DefiRate","Today's Crypto Yield Farming Rankings","The above resources have been sorted out alphabetically.","We are not affiliated with any link.

And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.","Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.","For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.","Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.","Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.","The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow."]},{"l":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"i":"0-definitions","l":"0.

Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.","To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.","A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.","To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.","To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.","An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

A\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.","The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.","The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.","The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work."]},{"i":"2-basic-permissions","l":"2.
